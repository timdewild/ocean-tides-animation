# Ocean Tides Animation
In this animation, made using [`matnimation`](https://github.com/timdewild/matnimation/tree/main), we visually demonstrate how the ocean tides on earth are generated due to the gravitational tidal fields of the moon and the sun. For more details, check out the corresponding [physics demos page](https://physicsdemos.web.rug.nl/digital-demos/classical-mechanics-dd/tidal-forces/).

> [!WARNING]
> In this repository, we have explicitly added the matnimation source code in the folder `~/matnimation`. A more elegant solution would be to import the matnimation source code as a submodule: see e.g. the [heating rod animation](https://github.com/timdewild/heat-equation-rod) for a proper implementation of this approach.
